    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
        This is a research project within the Department of Philosophy at the University of Washington. Our goal is to model the way that people categorize images with a series of boolean features.<br>This project builds on work by Fjaellingsdal et al. (2021) and Tyl√©n et al. (2023), but use a simpler model, essentially Bayesian, to predict agent behavior.<br>These previous studies aimed to understand how diversity and interaction between subjects would affect performance in the categorization task, and we may do something similar.
